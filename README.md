### DragonDScript
Hey everybody! I'm dragon, a passionate developer currently working on XStore, a free and cross platform store. [You can check it here.](https://github.com/dragonDScript)

I love Python and Javascript, but I've worked with C# and Java too.

My main language is not english, so you've may have seen some typos. Correct me if you see any, please!

Currently I use Ubuntu 20.04, because I love bash and ZSH. But I also like Windows and its technologies like BitLocker or UWP.

### ðŸ“š More info
I'm currently studying at 7th grade, and for that reason, I love playing games!
Ratchet and Clank is my favorite saga followed by others like Jax and Daxter. I also like creating worlds with Minecraft and LBP.

Yeah; I love PlayStation games as you've seen.
